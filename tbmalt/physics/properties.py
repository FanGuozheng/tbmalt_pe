    Arguments:
        eps: Energy eigenvalues (epsilon).
        energies: Energy values to evaluate the DoS at. These are assumed to
            be relative to the ``offset`` value, if it is specified.

        scale: Scales the DoS to have a maximum value of 1. [DEFAULT=False]

    Returns:

    Notes:
        The DoS is calculated via an equation equivalent to:

        .. math::
            g(E)=\delta(E-\epsilon_{i})

        Where g(E) is the density of states at an energy value E, and δ(E-ε)
        is the smearing width calculated as:

        .. math::
            \delta(E-\epsilon)=\frac{
                erf\left(\frac{E-\epsilon+\frac{\Delta E}{2}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)-
                erf\left(\frac{E-\epsilon+\frac{\Delta E}{2}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right)}
                {2\Delta E}

        Where ΔE is the difference in energy between neighbouring points.
        It may be useful, such as in the creation of a cost function, to have
        only specific states (i.e. HOMO, HOMO-1, etc.) used to construct the
        PDoS. State selection can be achieved via the ``mask`` argument. This
        should be a boolean tensor with a shape matching that of ``eps``. Only
        states whose mask value is True will be included in the DoS, e.g.

            mask = torch.Tensor([True, False, False, False])

        would only use the first state when constructing the DoS.

    Warnings:
        It is imperative that padding values are masked out when operating on
        batches of systems! Failing to do so will result in the emergence of
        erroneous state occupancies. Care must also be taken to ensure that
        the number of sample points is the same for each system; i.e. all
        systems have the same number of elements in ``energies``. As padding
        values will result in spurious behaviour.

    Notes:
        The PDoS is calculated via an equation equivalent to:

        .. math::
            g(\mu, E)=\sum_i \sum_v C_{\nu i}^* S_{\mu v} C_{\mu i} \delta(E-\epsilon_{i})

                {2\Delta E}

        Where ΔE is the difference in energy between neighbouring points. It
        is worth pointing out that the PDoS distributions should be treated as
        qualitative rather than quantitative.

        Masking operations are conducted in a manner identical to the ``dos``
        function; see ``dos`` function's documentation for more information.

        Unlike the ``dos`` function, ``pdos`` does not require faux states
        caused by zero padding to be masked out.
